# CarBattlersParts
My attempts at recreating the game Car Battler Joe's elements

Car Battler Joe (激闘！カーバトラーGO！！ Gekitou! Car Battler Go!!?) is a car battling video game for 
the Game Boy Advance, developed by Ancient and published by Natsume. The game involves using cars to
fight opponents in action-styled battles, with role-playing video game game mechanics.
It combined vehicular combat with action RPG elements in a similar manner to the earlier 
1985 game Autoduel based on Car Wars, and later 2006 MMO game Auto Assault.
